You're given an unordered list of unique integers called `nums`, in the range [1, n]
where n represents the length of `nums + 2`. This means that two numbers in this range
are missing from the list.

Write a function that takes in this list and returns a new list with the two mission numbers, sorted numerically

### Sample Input:

```
nums = [1, 4, 3]
```

### Sample Output:

```
[2, 5]
```
