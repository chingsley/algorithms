## Find Successor

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and a node in that tree, and returns the given nodes's successor.
In this tree, each node will have an additional pointer to
their parent node.

Note: a node's successor is the next node to be visited (immediately after the given node) when traversing the
tree using the "in-order-traversal" technique (left-current-right traversal). If a node is the last
node to be visited in the inorder traversal, then the node
has not successor, in that case, the function should return `null/none/nil`
