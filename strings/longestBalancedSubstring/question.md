### Longest Balanced Substring
Write a function that takes in a string made up of parentheses (( and )). The function
should return an integer representing the length of the longest balanced substring with
regards to parentheses.

A string is balanced if it has as many opening parentheses as it has closing parentheses

parentheses that comes before it; similarly, a closing parenthesis can't match an opening
parenthesis that comes after it.
